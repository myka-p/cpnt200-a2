- About the client:  
For this assignment, I will be creating content for a hypothetical client who owns a Filipino restaurant.  The project title Kamayan which is also the restaurant‚Äôs name is inspired by the Filipino‚Äôs traditional feast. In this feast, a table is lined with banana leaves and various kinds of foods, usually rice, some fried, and grilled dishes are spread out on the banana leaves. The people then all gather around the table to eat. What makes this feast unique is that people don‚Äôt use plates or utensils. Instead, they eat directly from the food spread and use their hand‚Äìwhich translates to *kamay* in Tagalog to scoop the food. In this assignment, I will focus on creating a database of the restaurant‚Äôs menu. The menu has options where the customer‚Äôs can choose from preset packages which have all the food in a usual Kamayan setting. The packages will vary depending on the serving sizes, add-ons, and complementaries. If the customers don‚Äôt want to order from the preset packages, they can choose from the a la-carte menu instead. Their website will also have a feature where the customer‚Äôs can book a reservation by themselves.
